# About Hephaestus

Hephaestus is a self-improving code generation system designed to propose, build, test, score, and improve its own components through an evolutionary process.

## Overview

The Hephaestus system follows the Node/Flow pattern from PocketFlow and implements a best-of-N approach to code generation. It consists of several key components:

- **Core Components**: The foundational Node/Flow pattern and Registry system
- **Engine Components**: Components for code generation and mutation
- **Scoring Components**: Systems for testing and evaluating generated code
- **Forge Loop**: The orchestration system for the complete build cycle

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the Hephaestus project are:

1. Create a system capable of generating and improving its own code
2. Develop reliable testing and evaluation mechanisms
3. Implement a self-improving loop that leads to increasingly better code
4. Build a foundation for future advanced code generation systems
