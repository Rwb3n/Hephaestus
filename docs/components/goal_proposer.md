# Goal Proposer

## Overview

The Goal Proposer is a strategic component within Hephaestus that analyzes the current codebase, requirements, and system context to identify potential areas for improvement or new features to implement. It acts as the strategic guidance system, determining what should be built or optimized next.

By understanding both the current state of the system and the desired capabilities, the Goal Proposer generates specific, actionable goals that drive the improvement cycle.

## Responsibilities

The Goal Proposer is responsible for:

1. **System Analysis**: Examining the current codebase and component registry
2. **Gap Identification**: Finding missing functionality or improvement opportunities
3. **Requirement Mapping**: Aligning identified gaps with system requirements
4. **Goal Formulation**: Generating specific, actionable improvement goals
5. **Priority Assignment**: Determining which goals should be addressed first

## Goal Types

The Goal Proposer can generate different types of goals:

### 1. Feature Addition

Goals focused on adding new functionality:
- Implementing new capabilities
- Adding support for new use cases
- Creating new components or modules

### 2. Optimization

Goals focused on improving existing functionality:
- Enhancing performance
- Reducing resource usage
- Improving code quality

### 3. Refactoring

Goals focused on restructuring the codebase:
- Improving modularity
- Enhancing extensibility
- Reducing technical debt

### 4. Bug Fixing

Goals focused on addressing issues:
- Correcting incorrect behavior
- Handling edge cases
- Improving error handling

## Workflow

The Goal Proposer follows this typical workflow:

1. **Input Collection**: Gather information about the current system state
2. **Analysis**: Examine the codebase, registry, and requirements
3. **Goal Generation**: Create potential improvement goals
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the impact and feasibility of each goal
5. **Selection**: Choose the most beneficial goals to pursue
6. **Output**: Provide specific, actionable goals to the Forge Loop

└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Configuration Options

The Goal Proposer can be configured with several parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Whether the component is active | `true` |
| `max_goals` | Maximum number of goals to propose | `5` |
| `goal_types` | Types of goals to consider | `["feature", "optimization", "refactoring", "bug"]` |
| `analysis_depth` | How deeply to analyze the codebase | `medium` |
| `require_tests` | Whether to require test coverage for goals | `true` |

## Integration Points

The Goal Proposer integrates with other Hephaestus components:

- **Registry**: Examines existing components to identify gaps
- **Forge Loop**: Provides goals to drive the improvement cycle
- **Mutation Engine**: Influences the selection of mutation strategies
- **Test Harness**: Considers test coverage in goal selection
- **Scoring System**: Uses quality metrics to identify improvement areas

## Usage Example

Here's how the Goal Proposer might be configured in a Hephaestus configuration file:

```yaml
components:
  goal_proposer:
    enabled: true
    max_goals: 3
    goal_types:
      - feature
      - optimization
    analysis_depth: high
    require_tests: true
```

## Best Practices

When working with the Goal Proposer:

1. **Start with a focused scope** for more manageable and specific goals
2. **Prioritize foundational components** before specialized ones
3. **Balance different goal types** for well-rounded system improvement
4. **Include detailed requirements** to guide goal generation
5. **Review and refine proposed goals** before implementation
6. **Provide feedback on goal quality** to improve future proposals

## Implementation Considerations

The Goal Proposer implementation includes:

- **Code Analysis**: Tools for examining code structure and patterns
- **Requirement Parsing**: Methods for understanding system requirements
- **Gap Analysis**: Algorithms for identifying missing functionality
- **Goal Generation**: Templates and patterns for creating specific goals
- **Priority Scoring**: Mechanisms for ranking goal importance

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the Goal Proposer include:

1. **Learning from Past Improvements**: Building knowledge base of successful patterns
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporating user suggestions and preferences
3. **Automated Gap Discovery**: More sophisticated analysis of missing features
4. **Goal Dependency Mapping**: Understanding relationships between goals
5. **Domain-Specific Goal Patterns**: Specialized goal templates for different domains
