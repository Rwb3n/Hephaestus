# Mutation Engine

## Overview

The Mutation Engine is a core component of Hephaestus responsible for generating code transformations to implement goals proposed by the Goal Proposer. It takes the current codebase and a specific goal as input and produces a modified codebase with the improvements or new features implemented.

The Mutation Engine employs various strategies to generate code changes, ranging from simple additions to complex refactorings, and ensures that the generated code maintains syntactic correctness and style consistency with the existing codebase.

## Responsibilities

The Mutation Engine is responsible for:

1. **Code Generation**: Creating new code implementations based on goals
2. **Code Transformation**: Modifying existing code to implement improvements
3. **Syntax Validation**: Ensuring generated code is syntactically correct
4. **Style Consistency**: Maintaining consistent coding style and practices
5. **Constraint Enforcement**: Adhering to specified constraints and requirements

## Mutation Strategies

The Mutation Engine supports multiple mutation strategies:

### 1. Additive

The additive strategy focuses on adding new code without significantly modifying existing code:
- Creating new functions, classes, or modules
- Adding new features to existing components
- Extending functionality through additional code paths

### 2. Refactoring

The refactoring strategy reorganizes existing code to improve its structure:
- Extracting reusable components
- Improving code organization
- Enhancing modularity and maintainability
- Optimizing algorithms and data structures

### 3. Transformative

The transformative strategy makes substantial changes to the codebase:
- Redesigning components or subsystems
- Implementing alternative algorithms
- Changing architectural patterns
- Repurposing existing code for new requirements

### 4. Hybrid

The hybrid strategy combines multiple approaches:
- Using different strategies for different parts of the codebase
- Applying sequential transformations (e.g., refactor then add)
- Balancing preservation and innovation

## Workflow

The Mutation Engine follows this typical workflow:

1. **Analysis**: Examine the current code and goal requirements
2. **Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate mutation strategies
3. **Transformation Planning**: Plan the sequence of code changes
4. **Code Generation**: Generate the transformed code
5. **Validation**: Verify syntax and basic correctness
6. **Output**: Produce the modified codebase

```

## Configuration Options

The Mutation Engine can be configured with several parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Whether the engine is active | `true` |
| `strategies` | List of enabled mutation strategies | `["additive", "refactoring"]` |
| `max_attempts` | Maximum attempts per goal | `5` |
| `code_style` | Code style configuration | `{}` |
| `preserve_comments` | Whether to preserve comments | `true` |
| `check_syntax` | Whether to validate syntax | `true` |

## Integration Points

The Mutation Engine integrates with other Hephaestus components:

- **Goal Proposer**: Receives goals to implement
- **Test Harness**: Provides implementations for testing
- **Execution Engine**: Validates syntactic correctness
- **Forge Loop**: Receives feedback for iterative improvement
- **Registry**: Accesses existing components for reference

## Usage Example

Here's how the Mutation Engine might be configured in a Hephaestus configuration file:

```yaml
components:
  mutation_engine:
    enabled: true
    strategies:
      - additive
      - refactoring
    max_attempts: 3
    code_style:
      line_length: 88
      use_spaces: true
      indent_size: 4
    preserve_comments: true
    check_syntax: true
```

## Best Practices

When working with the Mutation Engine:

1. **Start with additive strategies** for new features
2. **Use refactoring strategies** for optimization tasks
3. **Provide clear constraints** to guide the generation process
4. **Set appropriate style guidelines** to maintain consistency
5. **Review generated code** for quality and correctness
6. **Combine with test-driven approaches** for reliable results

## Implementation Considerations

The Mutation Engine implementation includes:

- **Code Parsing**: Utilities for parsing and understanding code structure
- **AST Manipulation**: Abstract Syntax Tree transformation capabilities
- **Code Generation**: Templates and patterns for creating code
- **Style Enforcement**: Rules and formatters for consistent style
- **Validation**: Syntax checkers and basic semantic validators

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the Mutation Engine include:

1. **Learning from Previous Mutations**: Building a knowledge base of successful transformations
2. **Language-Specific Optimizations**: Specialized strategies for different programming languages
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Deeper understanding of code meaning and behavior
4. **Multi-File Coordination**: Managing changes across multiple files
5. **Interactive Guidance**: Supporting human input during the mutation process
