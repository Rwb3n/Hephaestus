# Scoring System

## Overview

The Scoring System is a critical component in Hephaestus that evaluates the quality of code implementations across multiple dimensions. It provides objective metrics that guide the selection and improvement of code, ensuring that the system consistently produces high-quality outputs.

By applying comprehensive evaluation criteria, the Scoring System helps identify the best implementations and areas for improvement, driving the iterative refinement process.

## Responsibilities

The Scoring System is responsible for:

1. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluating code quality across multiple dimensions
2. **Metric Calculation**: Computing objective measures of implementation quality
3. **Comparison**: Comparing alternative implementations objectively
4. **Feedback Generation**: Providing detailed feedback on specific aspects
5. **Threshold Enforcement**: Ensuring implementations meet minimum quality standards

## Evaluation Dimensions

The Scoring System evaluates code across several dimensions:

### 1. Functionality

Assessing whether the code correctly implements the required functionality:
- Test passing rate
- Requirements coverage
- Edge case handling
- Error handling

### 2. Code Quality

Evaluating the structural quality of the code:
- Code style consistency
- Maintainability
- Readability
- Modularity

### 3. Performance

Measuring execution efficiency:
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Resource usage
- Execution speed

### 4. Compatibility

Assessing how well the code integrates with the existing system:
- API compatibility
- Dependency management
- Integration with existing components
- Platform compatibility

## Scoring Process

The Scoring System follows this typical workflow:

1. **Input Collection**: Gather implementation details and test results
2. **Metric Calculation**: Compute scores across all dimensions
3. **Weighting**: Apply dimension weights based on context
4. **Aggregation**: Combine weighted scores into a composite score
5. **Feedback Generation**: Provide detailed feedback and improvement suggestions
6. **Result Reporting**: Report final scores and recommendations

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│Input Collection │────▶│Metric Calculation│────▶│    Weighting    │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
                                                          │
                                                          │
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐              │
│ Result Reporting│◀────│Feedback Generation◀─────────────┘
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Configuration Options

The Scoring System can be configured with several parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Whether the component is active | `true` |
| `dimensions` | Evaluation dimensions to include | `["functionality", "code_quality", "performance"]` |
| `weights` | Relative weights for each dimension | `{"functionality": 0.5, "code_quality": 0.3, "performance": 0.2}` |
| `threshold` | Minimum acceptable composite score | `0.7` |
| `detailed_feedback` | Whether to generate detailed feedback | `true` |

## Integration Points

The Scoring System integrates with other Hephaestus components:

- **Test Harness**: Receives test results for functionality assessment
- **Mutation Engine**: Provides feedback for code improvement
- **Forge Loop**: Informs decision-making in the improvement cycle
- **Goal Proposer**: Helps identify areas for future improvement
- **Registry**: Records quality metrics for historical comparison

## Usage Example

Here's how the Scoring System might be configured in a Hephaestus configuration file:

```yaml
components:
  scoring_system:
    enabled: true
    dimensions:
      - functionality
      - code_quality
      - performance
    weights:
      functionality: 0.6
      code_quality: 0.3
      performance: 0.1
    threshold: 0.75
    detailed_feedback: true
```

## Best Practices

When working with the Scoring System:

1. **Align weights with project priorities** for relevant scoring
2. **Start with functionality-heavy weights** for initial implementations
3. **Increase code quality weights** as the project matures
4. **Review and tune thresholds** based on actual project needs
5. **Use detailed feedback** to guide specific improvements
6. **Compare scores across iterations** to track improvement

## Implementation Considerations

The Scoring System implementation includes:

- **Metric Calculators**: Specialized evaluators for each dimension
- **Weighting Mechanisms**: Configurable weight application
- **Aggregation Functions**: Methods for combining scores
- **Feedback Generators**: Templates for detailed feedback
- **Visualization Utilities**: Tools for representing scores

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the Scoring System include:

1. **Machine Learning-Based Scoring**: Training models on high-quality code
2. **Context-Aware Weighting**: Adjusting weights based on code context
3. **Custom Metric Definition**: Allowing users to define custom metrics
4. **Benchmark Comparison**: Comparing against known high-quality implementations
5. **Team Preference Learning**: Adapting to team-specific quality standards
