# Test Debug Protocol

## Overview

The Test Debug Protocol (TDP) is a standardized methodology and format for diagnosing, reporting, and resolving test failures in Hephaestus. It provides a structured approach to test failure analysis, enabling more efficient debugging and higher-quality implementation improvements.

By establishing a consistent protocol for test-related information exchange between components, TDP enhances Hephaestus's ability to understand, communicate, and resolve issues encountered during testing.

## Protocol Structure

The Test Debug Protocol consists of several interconnected elements:

1. **Test Failure Reports**: Structured descriptions of observed test failures
2. **Diagnostic Information**: Captured context and state data
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Systematic approach to determining failure origins
4. **Resolution Strategies**: Recommended approaches to fixing identified issues
5. **Verification Criteria**: Methods to confirm issue resolution

## Test Failure Reports

When a test fails, the Test Harness generates a standardized Failure Report:

```yaml
failure_report:
  id: "failure-20230615-001"
  test_case:
    id: "test_user_authentication"
    type: "unit"
    file: "tests/auth/test_user_auth.py"
    
  execution:
    timestamp: "2023-06-15T14:32:05Z"
    duration: 0.134
    environment: "local-runner"
    
  failure:
    type: "assertion_error"
    message: "Expected status code 200, got 401"
    stack_trace: |
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "tests/auth/test_user_auth.py", line 45, in test_user_authentication
          self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
      AssertionError: Expected status code 200, got 401
    
  context:
    inputs: 
      username: "test_user"
      password: "securepass123"
    outputs:
      response_code: 401
      response_body: "{'error': 'Invalid credentials'}"
    expected:
      response_code: 200
      response_body: "{'status': 'authenticated', 'token': '[TOKEN]'}"
```

## Diagnostic Information

The protocol collects additional diagnostic information:

1. **State Snapshots**: Application state before and after test execution
2. **Input/Output Captures**: Complete request and response data
3. **Performance Metrics**: Timing and resource usage data
4. **Environment Details**: Configuration and dependency information
5. **Execution Logs**: Relevant log entries from test execution

```yaml
diagnostic_information:
  state_snapshots:
    pre_execution:
      database:
        user_count: 15
        active_sessions: 3
      cache:
        size: "4.2MB"
        hit_ratio: 0.87
        
    post_execution:
      database:
        user_count: 15
        active_sessions: 3
      cache:
        size: "4.2MB"
        hit_ratio: 0.88
        
  logs:
    - timestamp: "2023-06-15T14:32:04.990Z"
      level: "INFO"
      message: "Received authentication request for user 'test_user'"
      
    - timestamp: "2023-06-15T14:32:05.015Z"
      level: "WARNING"
      message: "Password hash verification failed for user 'test_user'"
      
    - timestamp: "2023-06-15T14:32:05.020Z"
      level: "INFO"
      message: "Authentication failed, returning 401"
      
  performance:
    cpu_usage: "12%"
    memory_usage: "156MB"
    database_queries: 2
    query_time_total: 0.042
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The protocol implements a systematic approach to root cause identification:

```yaml
root_cause_analysis:
  probable_causes:
    - description: "Password hashing algorithm mismatch"
      confidence: 0.85
      evidence:
        - "Log entry at 14:32:05.015Z shows hash verification failure"
        - "No database schema changes detected"
        - "Authentication code recently updated in commit a1b2c3d"
      
    - description: "Database connection issue"
      confidence: 0.15
      evidence:
        - "Database query time (0.042s) is higher than baseline (0.025s)"
  
  affected_components:
    - name: "AuthenticationService"
      file: "src/services/auth_service.py"
      functions:
        - "verify_credentials"
        - "hash_password"
      
  related_tests:
    - id: "test_user_registration"
      status: "passing"
    - id: "test_password_reset"
      status: "failing"
```

## Resolution Strategies

Based on root cause analysis, the protocol suggests resolution approaches:

```yaml
resolution_strategies:
  recommended_strategy:
    description: "Update password verification to use correct hashing algorithm"
    confidence: 0.9
    
  implementation_suggestions:
    - "Modify src/services/auth_service.py:verify_credentials to use bcrypt instead of SHA-256"
    - "Add migration to update existing password hashes in database"
    - "Update password creation flow to use the same algorithm"
    
  estimated_effort: "medium"
  potential_side_effects:
    - "Existing users may need to reset passwords"
    - "Password reset functionality must be updated with the same algorithm"
    
  code_suggestions:
    - file: "src/services/auth_service.py"
      changes:
        - line: 78
          current: "return hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest() == stored_hash"
          suggested: "return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode(), stored_hash.encode())"
```

## Verification Criteria

The protocol defines how to verify that the issue is resolved:

```yaml
verification_criteria:
  test_cases:
    - id: "test_user_authentication"
      expected_result: "pass"
    - id: "test_password_reset"
      expected_result: "pass"
    - id: "test_existing_user_login"
      expected_result: "pass"
      
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All authentication tests pass"
    - "Existing users can still log in"
    - "New user registrations work correctly"
    
  verification_steps:
    - "Run affected test cases"
    - "Verify log output shows correct algorithm being used"
    - "Test with both new and existing user accounts"
```

## Integration with Hephaestus Components

The Test Debug Protocol integrates with several Hephaestus components:

- **Test Harness**: Generates test failure reports and diagnostic information
- **Mutation Engine**: Receives resolution strategies to guide code improvements
- **Scoring System**: Uses failure analysis to evaluate implementation quality
- **Forge Loop**: Incorporates debug insights into the improvement cycle
- **Registry**: Stores historical test failures and resolutions

## Usage Example

Here's how TDP might be used programmatically:

```python
from hephaestus.test import TestDebugProtocol

# When a test failure occurs
protocol = TestDebugProtocol()
failure_report = protocol.generate_failure_report(test_result)
diagnostic_info = protocol.collect_diagnostics(test_context)

# Analyze the failure
analysis = protocol.analyze_root_cause(failure_report, diagnostic_info)

# Generate resolution strategies
strategies = protocol.generate_resolution_strategies(analysis)

# Apply to mutation engine
mutation_engine.incorporate_debug_information(strategies)
```

## Best Practices

When working with the Test Debug Protocol:

1. **Collect comprehensive diagnostic data** for accurate analysis
2. **Focus on systemic patterns** in recurring failures
3. **Verify fixes against all related test cases**
4. **Document persistent issues** for knowledge sharing
5. **Update test cases** when implementation approaches change
6. **Analyze failure trends** to identify improvement opportunities

## Implementation Considerations

The Test Debug Protocol implementation includes:

- **Failure Collectors**: Gathering test failure information
- **Diagnostic Probes**: Collecting additional context data
- **Analysis Engines**: Interpreting failure patterns
- **Strategy Generators**: Creating resolution recommendations
- **Verification Frameworks**: Confirming issue resolution

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the Test Debug Protocol include:

1. **Machine Learning Analysis**: Using AI to identify complex failure patterns
2. **Visual Debugging Interfaces**: Interactive failure exploration tools
3. **Predictive Failure Prevention**: Identifying potential issues before they occur
4. **Cross-Project Learning**: Applying insights from similar projects
5. **Automated Repair Suggestions**: Generating code fixes automatically
6. **Historical Trend Analysis**: Learning from past debugging sessions
