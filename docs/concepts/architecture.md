# Hephaestus Architecture

## Overview

Hephaestus is an AI-powered code generation and optimization system designed to iteratively improve code through a self-reflective process. The system employs a series of specialized components working together to propose, implement, test, and refine code solutions.

The architecture follows a modular design where each component has a specific responsibility in the overall system. This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture and the interactions between its core components.

## Core Components

### 1. Goal Proposer

The Goal Proposer analyzes the current codebase, requirements, and system context to identify potential areas for improvement or new features to implement. It acts as the strategic guidance system, determining what should be built or optimized next.

**Responsibilities:**
- Analyze existing code patterns and architecture
- Identify missing functionality or optimization opportunities
- Prioritize goals based on system requirements
- Generate specific, actionable improvement goals

### 2. Mutation Engine

The Mutation Engine is responsible for generating code transformations to implement the goals proposed by the Goal Proposer. It takes the current codebase and a specific goal as input and produces a modified codebase.

**Responsibilities:**
- Generate code modifications to implement proposed goals
- Ensure syntactic correctness of produced code
- Maintain code style consistency with existing codebase
- Support multiple transformation strategies (additive, refactoring, etc.)

### 3. Execution Engine

The Execution Engine provides a secure, isolated environment to run and evaluate code implementations. It manages the execution context, resource limits, and interfaces with external dependencies.

**Responsibilities:**
- Create isolated execution environments
- Manage resource allocation and limits
- Execute code and capture outputs
- Provide standardized interfaces for external dependencies
- Ensure safe execution of potentially untrusted code

### 4. Test Harness

The Test Harness systematically evaluates code implementations against a set of tests and requirements. It provides quantitative and qualitative feedback on the functionality and quality of code implementations.

**Responsibilities:**
- Execute unit, integration, and system tests
- Measure code performance and resource usage
- Validate implementations against requirements
- Generate comprehensive test reports
- Track test coverage and edge cases

### 5. Scoring System

The Scoring System evaluates the quality of code implementations based on multiple dimensions, including correctness, efficiency, readability, and alignment with best practices.

**Responsibilities:**
- Apply multi-dimensional evaluation criteria
- Generate normalized quality scores
- Provide detailed feedback on specific aspects
- Compare alternatives objectively
- Adapt scoring based on context and requirements

### 6. Forge Loop

The Forge Loop coordinates the overall improvement cycle, managing the flow between components and tracking progress over time. It implements the iterative refinement process that is central to Hephaestus.

**Responsibilities:**
- Coordinate component interactions
- Track improvement iterations
- Apply termination criteria
- Manage historical context
- Control the overall optimization process

### 7. Registry

The Registry maintains a catalog of all components, their capabilities, and interfaces. It enables the dynamic composition of pipelines and the extensibility of the system.

**Responsibilities:**
- Catalog available components
- Manage component versioning
- Provide dependency resolution
- Support component discovery
- Enable system extensibility

## Interaction Flows

### 1. Improvement Cycle

1. The Goal Proposer analyzes the current system state and identifies improvement opportunities
2. The Mutation Engine generates code changes to implement the identified goals
3. The Execution Engine runs the modified code in a controlled environment
4. The Test Harness evaluates the modified code against requirements and tests
5. The Scoring System assesses the quality of the implementation
6. The Forge Loop evaluates results and decides whether to:
   - Accept the changes and move to the next goal
   - Request further refinement of the current goal
   - Reject the changes and try an alternative approach

### 2. Component Extension

1. A new component is registered with the Registry
2. The component provides metadata about its capabilities and interfaces
3. The Registry validates the component against system requirements
4. The Forge Loop can now incorporate the new component into execution pipelines
5. The Goal Proposer may suggest utilizing the new component for specific tasks

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed with clear boundaries and interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: The system can be extended with new components and capabilities
3. **Observability**: All processes and decisions are traceable and explainable
4. **Safety**: Execution is constrained and monitored to prevent harmful operations
5. **Adaptability**: Components can adjust their behavior based on context and feedback

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Communication Protocol**: Components communicate through a standardized message protocol
2. **State Management**: Persistent state is maintained in a centralized data store
3. **Resource Management**: Execution resources are explicitly allocated and monitored
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection, reporting, and recovery mechanisms
5. **Security**: Multi-layered security approach with principle of least privilege
