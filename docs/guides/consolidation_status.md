# Hephaestus Consolidation Status

This document tracks the progress of the Hephaestus system consolidation effort based on the proposal in `docs/proposals/consolidation_proposal.md`.

## Status Update (March 28, 2025)

Major progress has been made in Phase 2 of the consolidation effort:

1. ✅ Completed the scoring module reorganization
   - Moved TestHarness to scoring/test_harness/harness.py
   - Moved Scorer to scoring/scorer/scorer.py
   - Added proper module structure with __init__.py files
   - Created compatibility layers with deprecation warnings

2. ✅ Implemented comprehensive import tests
   - Created tests/test_imports.py to verify all import paths
   - Verified both new module paths and backward compatibility
   - All 8/8 import tests now passing

Next steps are focused on replacing relative imports with absolute ones and cleaning up empty directories by April 1, 2025.

## Current Status

The consolidation effort is now in progress, with Phase 1 (Component Consolidation) completed and significant progress on Phase 2 (Directory Structure Reorganization).

### Phase 1: Component Consolidation (Completed)

1. **BestOfNBuilder Consolidation**
   - ✅ Created consolidated implementation in `scoring/best_of_n.py`
   - ✅ Added deprecation warnings to `engine/best_of_n.py`
   - ✅ Updated imports in the scoring module
   - ✅ Added compatibility layer in `engine/__init__.py`

2. **Compatibility Layer**
   - ✅ Added forward compatibility import in `engine/__init__.py`
   - ✅ Added deprecation warnings with helpful messages
   - ✅ Created migration guide in `docs/guides/migration_guide.md`

3. **Testing**
   - ✅ Created integration tests in `tests/test_consolidation.py`

4. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with consolidation progress
   - ✅ Created migration guide for users

### Phase 2: Directory Structure Reorganization (In Progress)

1. **Core Structure**
   - ✅ Created `core` directory
   - ✅ Moved `base_node.py` and `flow.py` from `nodes/`
   - ✅ Moved `registry.py` from `registry/`
   - ✅ Added compatibility stubs in original locations
   - ✅ Added deprecation warnings to compatibility stubs
   - ✅ Created test script to verify imports

2. **Scoring Structure**
   - ✅ Moved `scoring.py` to `scoring/scorer/scorer.py`
   - ✅ Moved `test_harness.py` to `scoring/test_harness/harness.py`
   - ✅ Created proper module structure with __init__.py files
   - ✅ Added compatibility stubs with deprecation warnings
   - ✅ Updated imports in affected files

3. **Import Cleanup**
   - ✅ Implemented tests for verifying imports (tests/test_imports.py)
   - 🔄 Systematically replacing relative imports with absolute ones
   - 🔄 Run comprehensive tests to catch import errors
   - 🔄 Clean up empty directories

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Testing Framework (Planned)

1. **Test Structure**
   - [ ] Create test subdirectories (unit, integration, system)
   - [ ] Move existing tests to appropriate locations
   - [ ] Update test runner to support new structure

2. **Test Coverage**
   - [ ] Add missing tests to achieve coverage goals
   - [ ] Implement enhanced mock components
   - [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical paths

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow
   - [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
   - [ ] Add integration test automation

### Phase 4: Documentation (Planned)

1. **API Documentation**
   - [ ] Document new directory structure
   - [ ] Create comprehensive API reference
   - [ ] Write migration guides for deprecated components

2. **User Guides**
   - [ ] Create getting started guide
   - [ ] Document configuration options
   - [ ] Write troubleshooting guide

3. **Examples**
   - [ ] Create example implementations
   - [ ] Document common usage patterns
   - [ ] Add a cookbook for best practices

## Known Issues

- The integration with ForgeLoop needs to be tested with the consolidated BestOfNBuilder
- Empty directories still exist in the project (`builder/`, `goals/goal_examples/`)

## Timeline

- ✅ Phase 1: Component Consolidation - Completed
- ⏳ Phase 2: Directory Reorganization - In Progress
- 📅 Phase 3: Testing Framework - Planned
- 📅 Phase 4: Documentation - Planned
