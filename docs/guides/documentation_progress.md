### Templates and Standards
- ✅ Created standardized documentation templates:
  - [Component Template](../templates/component_template.md)
  - [Guide Template](../templates/guide_template.md)
  - [Proposal Template](../templates/proposal_template.md)
  - [FAQ Template](../templates/faq_template.md)
  - [Contribution Guide](../templates/contribution_guide.md)
  - [Style Guide](../templates/style_guide.md)
- ✅ Developed documentation structure for MkDocs implementation
- ✅ Created example MkDocs configuration file
- ✅ Prepared requirements.txt for documentation dependencies

### Automation Tools
- ✅ Created documentation setup script (`docs/scripts/setup_docs.py`)
- ✅ Created documentation migration script (`docs/scripts/migrate_docs.py`)
- ✅ Created component documentation generator (`docs/scripts/generate_component_docs.py`)

## Current Focus

The team is currently focused on **Phase 1: Structure & Organization**:

1. **Documentation Framework Setup**:
   - Setting up MkDocs with Material theme
   - Configuring plugins for enhanced functionality
   - Setting up the build pipeline

2. **Directory Structure Implementation**:
   - Creating the necessary directory structure for documentation
   - Setting up asset directories for images and stylesheets
   - Preparing for migration of existing documentation

## Next Steps

The following tasks are scheduled for the next two weeks:

| Task | Start Date | End Date | Status |
|------|------------|----------|--------|
| Set up documentation pipeline | Apr 1, 2025 | Apr 5, 2025 | Not Started |
| Implement documentation structure | Apr 5, 2025 | Apr 10, 2025 | Not Started |
| Migrate existing documentation | Apr 10, 2025 | Apr 20, 2025 | Not Started |
| Review and reorganize file structure | Apr 20, 2025 | Apr 25, 2025 | Not Started |

## Metrics

- **Templates completed**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Framework evaluation**: Completed
- **Implementation plan**: Completed
- **Directory structure**: In progress

## Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Organizing existing documentation | Creating a mapping between current and new structure |
| Managing versions during transition | Maintaining backward links and redirects |
| Ensuring consistent styling | Created comprehensive style guide and templates |
