# Phase 2 Progress Summary: Scoring Module Reorganization

Date: March 28, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Scoring Module Reorganization

The scoring module has been successfully reorganized into proper submodules, following modern Python package structure:

- ✅ Created `scoring/test_harness/` with proper structure
  - `harness.py` - Core implementation
  - `__init__.py` - Package exports
  - Migrated code from `scoring/test_harness.py`

- ✅ Created `scoring/scorer/` with proper structure
  - `scorer.py` - Core implementation
  - `__init__.py` - Package exports
  - Migrated code from `scoring/scoring.py`

- ✅ Updated module imports throughout
  - Fixed imports to use new module structure
  - Added compatibility layers for backward compatibility
  - Created deprecation warnings to guide users to new imports

- ✅ Updated main `scoring/__init__.py` to export from new locations
  - Consolidated all exports in a single location
  - Ensured backward compatibility

### 2. Import Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework has been created to verify imports:

- ✅ Created `tests/test_imports.py`
  - Tests core module imports
  - Tests compatibility imports
  - Tests all levels of the scoring module imports
  - Handles Python path setup automatically

- ✅ Verified 8/8 import tests passing
  - Core Node and Registry imports
  - Compatibility imports from old locations
  - Direct, submodule, and implementation imports for scoring

### 3. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with reorganization details
- ✅ Updated consolidation_status.md with progress
- ✅ Updated project_status.md to reflect completed reorganization

## Next Steps

1. **Replace Relative Imports** - Systematically replace all relative imports with absolute ones throughout the codebase
2. **Clean Up Empty Directories** - Remove directories that are no longer needed after reorganization
3. **Run Comprehensive Tests** - Test the entire system with the reorganized structure

The current progress places us on track to complete Phase 2 by April 1, 2025, as scheduled.
