# Documentation Reorganization and Test Run Preparation

## Overview

This proposal outlines a structured approach to reorganize our documentation, better integrate existing technical content, and prepare for the first test runs of the Hephaestus system.

## Objectives

1. Make existing technical documentation more accessible through the MkDocs structure
2. Create clear onboarding paths for new users and developers
3. Establish practical guides for running Hephaestus
4. Set up sample projects for testing and demonstration

## Timeline and Tasks

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Documentation Reorganization**
   - Move architecture and core component descriptions into the MkDocs structure
   - Integrate status documents into a consistent reporting format
   - Update navigation in mkdocs.yml to reflect new structure

2. **Getting Started Documentation**
   - Create installation guide with environment setup instructions
   - Document basic configuration options
   - Provide simple example workflows

### Short-term Goals (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Test Run Preparation**
   - Develop step-by-step tutorial for first test run
   - Create configuration templates for common use cases
   - Document expected outputs and interpretation guides

2. **Sample Project Setup**
   - Build 2-3 small example projects of varying complexity
   - Include instructions for modifying and extending examples
   - Document common patterns and best practices

### Medium-term Goals (Weeks 4-6)

1. **Component Integration and Testing**
   - Test full pipeline integration
   - Document component interactions
   - Create troubleshooting guides based on actual test runs

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Analyze system performance on sample projects
   - Document resource requirements
   - Provide optimization strategies

### Long-term Vision (Months 2-3)

1. **Community Building**
   - Develop contribution guidelines
   - Set up community forums or discussion channels
   - Create showcase of successful implementations

2. **Extension and Plugin System**
   - Document API for extensions
   - Create plugin development tutorial
   - Build sample plugins

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Documentation Structure Updates

```
docs/
├── concepts/        # Core concepts and architecture
│   ├── architecture.md
│   ├── execution.md
│   └── ...
├── components/      # Detailed component documentation
│   ├── forge_loop.md
│   ├── mutation.md
│   ├── registry.md
│   └── ...
├── guides/          # User and developer guides
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   ├── configuration.md
│   ├── test-run.md
│   └── ...
├── reference/       # Technical reference
│   ├── api.md
│   ├── configuration.md
│   └── ...
└── status/          # Project status and updates
    └── ...
```

### 2. New Documents to Create

- guides/getting-started.md
- guides/test-run.md
- guides/configuration.md
- components/index.md (overview of system components)
- reference/troubleshooting.md

### 3. Integration Process

1. For each technical document:
   - Review content and update as needed
   - Move to appropriate location in new structure
   - Update internal links
   - Add to mkdocs.yml navigation

2. For each new document:
   - Create template with consistent structure
   - Fill with content based on existing technical documents
   - Cross-reference related documents

## Success Criteria

- All documentation accessible through MkDocs site
- New users can successfully install and run Hephaestus
- Test runs can be completed following documentation alone
- Documentation structure allows for easy future expansion

## Next Steps

1. Begin with reorganization of core architecture documents
2. Create getting-started.md as priority first new document
3. Update weekly based on progress and feedback
