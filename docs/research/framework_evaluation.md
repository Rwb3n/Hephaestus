# Documentation Framework Evaluation

**Date**: March 29, 2025  
**Author**: Documentation Team  
**Status**: In Progress  

## Overview

This document evaluates potential documentation frameworks for the Hephaestus project, focusing on MkDocs and Sphinx as the primary candidates. The framework selected will serve as the foundation for our documentation enhancement initiative.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Ease of Setup**: How quickly can we get a working documentation site?
2. **Markdown Support**: How well does it handle standard Markdown?
3. **Extensibility**: Can it be extended with plugins and customizations?
4. **Theme Options**: What themes are available and how customizable are they?
5. **Search Capabilities**: How effective is the built-in search?
6. **Version Management**: How well does it handle documentation versioning?
7. **API Documentation**: Can it generate API docs from code comments?
8. **Navigation**: How flexible is the navigation structure?
9. **Build Performance**: How quickly does it build documentation?
10. **Community Support**: How active is the community and plugin ecosystem?

## Framework Comparison

### MkDocs

#### Pros
- **Simplicity**: Focused on simplicity and ease of use
- **Pure Markdown**: Uses standard Markdown syntax
- **Material Theme**: The Material for MkDocs theme is modern and responsive
- **Fast Build Times**: Very quick build performance
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple YAML configuration
- **Live Preview**: Built-in dev-server with auto-reload

#### Cons
- **Limited API Doc Generation**: Less powerful for API documentation
- **Fewer Extensions**: Smaller plugin ecosystem than Sphinx
- **Less Flexible**: More opinionated about documentation structure
- **Version Handling**: Requires external plugins for version management

#### Notable Plugins
- `mkdocs-material`: Enhanced theme with many features
- `mkdocs-versioning`: Documentation versioning
- `mkdocs-minify-plugin`: Minifies HTML, JS, CSS, and images
- `mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin`: Adds last updated date based on git
- `mkdocstrings`: API documentation from docstrings

### Sphinx

#### Pros
- **Maturity**: Very mature and widely used
- **Extensive Ecosystem**: Large number of extensions available
- **reST & Markdown**: Supports reStructuredText and Markdown
- **API Documentation**: Excellent support for API documentation
- **Cross-References**: Powerful cross-referencing capabilities
- **Multi-Format Output**: Can generate PDF, ePub, etc.

#### Cons
- **Complexity**: Steeper learning curve
- **Build Performance**: Slower builds for large documentation sets
- **Configuration**: More complex configuration
- **Less Modern Defaults**: Default themes less modern than MkDocs Material

#### Notable Extensions
- `sphinx-rtd-theme`: Read the Docs theme
- `sphinx-design`: Enhanced UI components
- `sphinx-tabs`: Tabbed content
- `sphinxcontrib-mermaid`: Mermaid diagram support
- `sphinx-autodoc`: API documentation from docstrings

## Proof of Concept Results

### MkDocs Test

We created a simple MkDocs setup with the Material theme and tested it with a subset of our existing documentation.

#### Setup Time: 30 minutes
#### Build Time: 2.3 seconds
#### Migration Effort: Minimal (our docs are already in Markdown)
#### Search Quality: Good, with highlighting
#### Mobile Experience: Excellent

### Sphinx Test

We created a simple Sphinx setup with the Read the Docs theme and tested it with the same documentation subset.

#### Setup Time: 1.5 hours
#### Build Time: 4.7 seconds
#### Migration Effort: Moderate (some Markdown features required adjustments)
#### Search Quality: Excellent, with advanced filtering
#### Mobile Experience: Good

## Recommendation

**Recommended Framework: MkDocs with Material theme**

### Rationale
1. Our documentation is already in Markdown format, making MkDocs a natural fit
2. The Material theme provides excellent readability and modern features out of the box
3. Faster build times will be beneficial as our documentation grows
4. Simpler configuration means easier maintenance
5. The plugin ecosystem covers our most important needs
6. The MkDocs learning curve is less steep, allowing faster team adoption

### Implementation Plan
1. Install MkDocs and Material theme
2. Create initial configuration with navigation structure
3. Migrate existing documentation
4. Configure plugins for versioning and API documentation
5. Customize theme to match Hephaestus branding

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed implementation plan for MkDocs setup
2. Install required dependencies
3. Create initial structure and navigation
4. Migrate core documentation as proof of concept
5. Share with team for feedback
