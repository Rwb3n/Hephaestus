## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Resource constraints | High | Medium | Prioritize critical documentation; distribute workload across teams |
| Technical challenges with documentation framework | Medium | Low | Research thoroughly before implementation; maintain backup options |
| Resistance to documentation standards | Medium | Medium | Communicate benefits; provide templates and examples |
| Knowledge gaps | High | Medium | Conduct interviews with subject matter experts; schedule knowledge transfer sessions |

## Success Criteria

- Documentation structure implemented and templates in use
- Documentation build pipeline established
- 90% of existing documentation migrated to new system
- Documentation gaps identified and prioritized
- New documentation meets quality standards (to be defined in style guide)
- Documentation search functionality implemented and working
- User feedback indicates improved usability
