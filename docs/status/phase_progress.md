# Hephaestus Consolidation Phase Progress

> **Note**: This is the consolidated document for tracking phase progress in the Hephaestus consolidation effort. It replaces the individual phase summary documents and serves as the authoritative source for tracking progress across all phases.

This document tracks the chronological progress of the Hephaestus system consolidation effort, with the most recent updates at the top. It provides a comprehensive record of completed tasks, ongoing work, and next steps for each phase of the consolidation process.

## Phase 2 Progress: Scoring Module Reorganization (March 28, 2025)

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Scoring Module Reorganization

The scoring module has been successfully reorganized into proper submodules, following modern Python package structure:

- ✅ Created `scoring/test_harness/` with proper structure
  - `harness.py` - Core implementation
  - `__init__.py` - Package exports
  - Migrated code from `scoring/test_harness.py`

- ✅ Created `scoring/scorer/` with proper structure
  - `scorer.py` - Core implementation
  - `__init__.py` - Package exports
  - Migrated code from `scoring/scoring.py`

- ✅ Updated module imports throughout
  - Fixed imports to use new module structure
  - Added compatibility layers for backward compatibility
  - Created deprecation warnings to guide users to new imports

- ✅ Updated main `scoring/__init__.py` to export from new locations
  - Consolidated all exports in a single location
  - Ensured backward compatibility

#### 2. Import Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework has been created to verify imports:

- ✅ Created `tests/test_imports.py`
  - Tests core module imports
  - Tests compatibility imports
  - Tests all levels of the scoring module imports
  - Handles Python path setup automatically

- ✅ Verified 8/8 import tests passing
  - Core Node and Registry imports
  - Compatibility imports from old locations
  - Direct, submodule, and implementation imports for scoring

#### 3. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with reorganization details
- ✅ Updated consolidation_status.md with progress
- ✅ Updated project_status.md to reflect completed reorganization

### Next Steps

1. **Replace Relative Imports** - Systematically replace all relative imports with absolute ones throughout the codebase
2. **Clean Up Empty Directories** - Remove directories that are no longer needed after reorganization
3. **Run Comprehensive Tests** - Test the entire system with the reorganized structure

The current progress places us on track to complete Phase 2 by April 1, 2025, as scheduled.

## Phase 2 Progress: Core Infrastructure Reorganization (March 27, 2025)

### Accomplishments

#### 1. Core Infrastructure Reorganization

- ✅ Created a dedicated `core/` directory to house the foundational components of the system
- ✅ Moved `base_node.py` and `flow.py` from the `nodes/` directory to `core/`
- ✅ Moved `registry.py` from the `registry/` directory to `core/`
- ✅ Enhanced docstrings and improved code organization in the moved files

#### 2. Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Added compatibility stubs in the original locations (`nodes/base_node.py`, `nodes/flow.py`, `registry/registry.py`)
- ✅ Implemented clear deprecation warnings to guide users toward the new import paths
- ✅ Created a module-level `__init__.py` for both `nodes/` and `registry/` to maintain package imports
- ✅ Ensured all imports continue to work seamlessly during the transition period

#### 3. Testing & Validation

- ✅ Created a comprehensive test script (`tests/test_core_imports.py`) to verify both new and legacy imports
- ✅ Validated that deprecation warnings are correctly displayed when using legacy imports
- ✅ Verified that all components can be instantiated correctly from both old and new import paths

#### 4. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated `CHANGELOG.md` to reflect the directory reorganization
- ✅ Updated `docs/project_status.md` to reflect the current state of the project
- ✅ Updated `docs/guides/consolidation_status.md` to track the progress of Phase 2
