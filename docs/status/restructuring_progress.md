# Documentation Restructuring Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Hephaestus documentation restructuring initiative. The goal is to create a more organized, comprehensive, and user-friendly documentation structure.

## Completed Tasks

### Core Structure Setup
- [x] Created new documentation directory structure
- [x] Set up MkDocs configuration
- [x] Added requirements for documentation dependencies
- [x] Created installation script for documentation setup

### Content Migration
- [x] Migrated Forge Loop documentation to components directory
- [x] Migrated Mutation Engine documentation to components directory
- [x] Migrated Goal Proposer documentation to components directory
- [x] Migrated Test Harness documentation to components directory
- [x] Migrated Scoring System documentation to components directory
- [x] Migrated/created Registry documentation to components directory
- [x] Migrated Architecture documentation to concepts directory
- [x] Migrated Execution Model documentation to concepts directory

### New Content Creation
- [x] Created Components Overview page
- [x] Created Directive Format documentation
- [x] Created Test Debug Protocol documentation
- [x] Created Running Tests guide
- [x] Created Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Created detailed Execution Model documentation

### Navigation Structure Updates
- [x] Updated main navigation in mkdocs.yml
- [x] Created logical groupings for documentation sections
- [x] Added new documentation pages to navigation structure

### File Consolidation and Cleanup
- [x] Removed duplicate files from root directory after migration
- [x] Verified all component documentation is properly located
- [x] Verified all concept documentation is properly located
- [x] Consolidated duplicate troubleshooting guides into comprehensive version
- [x] Fixed broken cross-references in the Getting Started guide

### Maintenance Tools
- [x] Created script to check for duplicate documentation files
- [x] Created script to validate documentation structure and find issues
- [x] Added documentation of known issues for future improvement

## In Progress Tasks

### Remaining Content Migration
- [ ] Migrate Configuration Reference to reference directory
- [ ] Migrate API documentation to reference directory

### New Content Creation
- [ ] Create Quick Start guide
- [ ] Create Contributing guide
- [ ] Create Extensions and Plugins documentation
- [ ] Create Performance Tuning guide

### Content Enhancement
- [ ] Add diagrams to component documentation
- [ ] Enhance examples with more realistic use cases
- [ ] Add cross-references between related documentation
- [ ] Add search-friendly keywords and metadata
- [ ] Fix remaining broken internal links identified by validation tool

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Content Migration**:
   - Review and update Configuration Reference
   - Ensure API documentation is consistent and comprehensive

2. **Create Configuration Reference**:
   - Document all configuration options
   - Provide examples for common configurations
   - Add validation rules and constraints

3. **Improve Examples**:
   - Create a repository of example directives
   - Add step-by-step tutorials for common use cases
   - Provide code samples for component interactions

4. **Prepare for Test Run**:
   - Update test-run.md with latest features
   - Create a comprehensive tutorial for first-time users
   - Document troubleshooting for common test issues

5. **Maintenance and Quality**:
   - Fix remaining broken links identified by validation tool
   - Create missing index files for internal directories
   - Ensure all documentation files are properly referenced in navigation

## Metrics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Documents Migrated | 8 |
| New Documents Created | 6 |
| Directories Organized | 5 |
| Duplicate Files Removed | 11 |
| Navigation Updates | 1 |
| Content Consolidations | 1 |
| Maintenance Scripts | 2 |

## Issues and Challenges

- Compatibility issues with MkDocs dependencies need to be resolved
- Some existing documentation contains outdated information that needs verification
- Need to maintain cross-references while moving documents to new locations
- Balancing technical depth with readability for different audience levels
- Several broken internal links identified by validation tool need to be fixed

## Notes for Future Work

- Consider implementing a search functionality improvement for the documentation
- Explore options for API documentation generation from code
- Set up automated testing for documentation examples to ensure they stay current
- Create a documentation style guide for contributors
- Implement version control for documentation to match software releases
- Develop a script to automatically check for and identify duplicate content
- Integrate validation scripts into CI/CD pipeline
