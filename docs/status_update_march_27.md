3. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Created comprehensive project status document
   - Integrated and enhanced the roadmap with detailed implementation goals
   - Added timeline estimates for upcoming milestones
   - Updated CHANGELOG to reflect all recent changes

## First Project Test Run Plan

We are targeting **April 15, 2025** for the first full project test run. This milestone will involve:

1. **Preparation Tasks**
   - Complete Phase 2 (Directory Structure Reorganization) by April 1
   - Implement basic integration tests for the consolidated components
   - Verify ForgeLoop compatibility with consolidated BestOfNBuilder
   - Prepare test scenarios covering the full build cycle

2. **Test Execution Process**
   - Setup test environment with all required dependencies
   - Configure OpenAI API access for LLM integration
   - Run the full Hephaestus system with sample directives
   - Log and analyze the system's behavior throughout the process

3. **Success Metrics**
   - Successful generation of code variants
   - Proper scoring and selection of best variants
   - Persistent storage in the Registry
   - Lineage tracking across multiple generations
   - Error handling and recovery from failures

4. **Post-Test Analysis**
   - Document all findings and issues
   - Prioritize fixes and improvements
   - Update the roadmap based on test results
   - Prepare for Phase 3 (Testing Framework Enhancement)

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term (Next 2 weeks)**
   - Complete the scoring module reorganization
   - Replace relative imports with absolute ones
   - Clean up empty directories
   - Begin work on structured test organization

2. **Medium-term (Next 4-6 weeks)**
   - Complete Phase 3 (Testing Framework Enhancement)
   - Begin Phase 4 (Documentation)
   - Prepare for Version 0.1.1 release (May 1, 2025)

3. **Long-term (Next 3 months)**
   - Begin work on Version 0.2.0 features
   - Implement specialized Node types
   - Develop Registry visualization tools

## Conclusion

The Hephaestus project is making steady progress toward a more maintainable, reliable, and well-documented codebase. The completion of Phase 1 and significant progress on Phase 2 demonstrate the commitment to quality and sustainable development practices. The upcoming first project test run will be a crucial milestone in validating the changes made so far and setting the direction for future enhancements.
